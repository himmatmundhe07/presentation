  <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>

  <hr>

  <h2>Early Computers</h2>
  <p>
    The history of computers started with <b>mechanical devices</b> like the abacus.
    Later, Charles Babbage worked on the <u>Analytical Engine</u> which is called the <strong>first programmable
      computer idea</strong>.
    Ada Lovelace is known as the first programmer because she wrote an <i>algorithm</i> for this machine.
    In the 1940s machines like <abbr title="Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer">ENIAC</abbr> used <mark>vacuum
      tubes</mark> to calculate faster.
    They were <small>huge</small> and used a lot of power.
    People had to set <code>switches</code> and cables to run them.
    Punch cards were used to store <var>1</var> and <var>0</var>.
    The accuracy was very important because even an error rate of 10<sup>-3</sup> could cause problems.

  <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
  <p>
    Computers are divided into <b>generations</b>.
    The first used <mark>vacuum tubes</mark>, the second used <i>transistors</i>, then <strong>integrated
      circuits</strong>, and later <em>microprocessors</em>.
    The <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> became smaller and faster with each step.
    Memory changed from drums to <u>RAM</u> chips.
    Languages also improved from <code>assembly</code> to higher ones like <abbr
      title="Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code">BASIC</abbr> and <abbr
      title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
    <del>Mainframes for all users</del> got replaced by <ins>personal computers</ins>.
    <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> made them easier for normal people to use.
  </p>

  <h2>Math in Computing</h2>
  <p>
    Computers depend a lot on math.
    Example: E = mc<sup>2</sup> is a famous formula.
    Another example is H<sub>2</sub>O which is water.
    Algorithms are measured in O(<var>n</var><sup>2</sup>) or O(<var>n</var> log <var>n</var>).
    Cryptography uses math like <code>a^b mod m</code>.
    To type a power sign you can press <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>6</kbd>, and the system might show <samp>Inserted '^'
      symbol</samp>.
  </p>

  <h2>Birth of the Internet</h2>
  <p>
    The Internet started with <abbr title="Advanced Research Projects Agency Network">ARPANET</abbr>.
    Later <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol">TCP/IP</abbr> connected networks together.
    Tim Berners-Lee made the <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> which used <abbr
      title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> and <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.
    It allowed <em>hyperlinks</em> to connect documents.
    Soon browsers and email became common.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    "The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect."
    â€“ <cite>Tim Berners-Lee</cite>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Modern Era</h2>
  <p>
    Today we have <small>smartphones</small> and cloud computing.
    Internet moved from <del>dial-up</del> to <ins>fiber and broadband</ins>.
    Open standards like <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> and <abbr
      title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> are everywhere.
    Security like <em>end-to-end encryption</em> is important.
    Technology is powerful but must be used with <strong>responsibility</strong>.

  <h2>Computer Example</h2>
  <p>
    Below is a small HTML example.
    The <var>message</var> variable stores text.
    You can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> to paste it.
    If something goes wrong, the system might show <samp>Error: variable not defined</samp>.
